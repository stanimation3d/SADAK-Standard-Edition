SADAK is a standard file system compatible with the Sahne64 API developed by Sahne Dünya. The file system's core design uses Copy-on-Write (CoW), just like ZFS/Btrfs. It performs fully atomic operations for data integrity, but there's no checksum in this area. There's built-in RAID support. Memory management is handled directly in the kernel, and there's also caching capability. Snapshot support is built-in. What's even more interesting is that this file system was originally developed exclusively for the Sahne Karnal architecture. If you read the documentation "https://github.com/stanimation3d/Sahne-Karnal-Standard-Edition/blob/main/drivers_support.md" about which operating system components support hardware for this architecture, supporting persistent storage devices like NVMe SSDs, SATA SSDs, SATA HDDs, SD, MicroSD, UFS, and eMMC is entirely the responsibility of the file system; the operating system kernel has no such responsibility. This means that the architecture is MikroKernel, but it is very important to read this documentation because it uses the extended MikroKernel architecture!
