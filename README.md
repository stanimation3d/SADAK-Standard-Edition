SADAK is a standard file system compatible with the Sahne64 API developed by Sahne Dünya. The file system's core design uses Copy-on-Write (CoW), just like ZFS/Btrfs. It performs fully atomic operations for data integrity, but there's no checksum in this area. It has built-in RAID support. Memory management is handled directly in the kernel, and it also has caching capabilities. Snapshot support is built-in. What's even more interesting is that this file system was originally developed exclusively for the Sahne Karnal architecture. If you've read the documentation about which operating system components support hardware for this architecture, you'll know that supporting persistent storage hardware like NVMe SSDs, SATA SSDs, SATA HDDs, SD, MicroSD, UFS, and eMMC is entirely the file system's responsibility; the operating system kernel has no such responsibility. This means the architecture is MicroKernel, but it's crucial to read this documentation because it uses the extended MicroKernel architecture!
